Terminal paint
==============

How to use
----------

terminal-paint uses ruby >= 2.1 for mandatory named parameters.
It's been released for almost a whole day, so
everyone must have it by now, right? ;)

If you run it as
```
bundle exec ruby paint.rb
```
bundle will check your ruby version for you. If you don't use bundle,
run it manually as `ruby paint.rb`. Or make it executable:
```
chmod +x paint.rb
```
then run as
```
./paint.rb
```
